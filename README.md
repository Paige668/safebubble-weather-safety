# SafeBubble - Weather & Family Safety App

**A unified emergency monitoring solution that combines friend/family location tracking with real-time weather and disaster data.**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

During emergencies, users frequently switch between location-sharing apps (Find My, Life360) and weather apps to track both people and hazardous conditions. This creates friction and delays in critical situations where every second counts.

## 💡 Our Solution

SafeBubble provides a unified platform that combines:
- **Location Management**: Track important places (home, work, family locations)
- **Weather Integration**: Real-time weather alerts and radar overlays
- **Risk Assessment**: Automatic risk level calculation based on proximity to weather events
- **Emergency Mode**: Optimized interface for high-stress situations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd safebubble-app
npm run install:all
```

2. **Start the development servers:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Frontend (React): http://localhost:3000
- Backend (Express): http://localhost:5000
